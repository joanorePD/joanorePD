# Hola a tothom, Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Joan, a passionate Data Science student from Barcelona with a love for reinforcement learning. Here's a bit about me in code

```python
class Me:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Joan Orellana Rios"
        self.title = "Graduate Student in Data Science"
        self.location = "Padova, Italy"
        self.interests = ["Coding", "Data Science", "Reinforcement Learning", "Guitar", "Coffee"]

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f"Hello, World! I'm {self.name}, a {self.title} based in {self.location}.")

    def current_projects(self):
        return ["MEB and Anomaly Detection", "Crypto-Currency Forecasting"]

    def find_me_online(self):
        return {
            "LinkedIn": "linkedin.com/in/joanorellanarios",
            "Email": "joanorellanarios@gmail.com",
        }

# Instantiate Me
me = Me()

# Say hello and share current projects
me.say_hello()
print("Current Projects:", me.current_projects())

# Find me online
print("Find Me Online:")
for platform, link in me.find_me_online().items():
    print(f"{platform}: {link}")
```

## About Me

I'm a student currently based in Padova, Italy, although my heart belongs to Barcelonaâ€”my favorite city in the world. Currently pursuing a master's degree in Data Science, my tech journey commenced with a profound fascination for all things related to AI, particularly in the realm of computer vision.
